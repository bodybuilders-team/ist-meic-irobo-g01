The costmap seems to represent the occupancy grid inflated by the robot polygon

(TODO: Take screenshot of global and local costmap)

Try to use move_base without providing it the global map generated by slam.

In the first video, we can visualize that the cost_map adds obstacles based on the laser_scan and the given map, and it clears the obstacles by doing a ray tracing from the robot position to the laser scan point cloud. It clears all the obstacles that are between any point in the cloud and the robot.

Local planner only uses odometry and the laser scanner, it does not use the localization provided by amcl nor the map generated by slam.
